From having read <http://xprogramming.com/articles/xprognew-pivot/>,
here's what [Amitai](http://www.schmonz.com/) understands.

## You want to...

- Write and draw pictures
- Self-publish them
- Generate a static site with simple tools
- Integrate XProgramming, new material, maybe your Tumblr
- Organize these articles into something like WordPress's categories
- Feel comfortable maintaining the site even if the tools go south

## You wantn't to...

- Maintain a database-backed dynamic CMS (such as WordPress)
- Fiddle with an app stack (such as Ruby/Sinatra/Kramdown/etc.)
- Deal with undocumented tools (such as Middleman)
- Code it up (unless it looks like you have to)

## More specific wants

### Front page

The site's front page shows two rows:

- Row 1: most recent Beyond, most recent Kate, random Classic
- Row 2: 5-6 most recent general articles

### Categories

That's because articles are classified into categories:

- Kate
- Beyond
- Classic
- general

Each category needs its own index page. If it's long, split it up
into multiple pages.

### Articles

Articles about generally Agile topics...

- Ought to be classified into some category (maybe Beyond, maybe a new one)
- Might be part of a sequence, might not

For each article: 

- Text and associated pictures go in their own folder
    - For easy previewing in Sublime Text and Marked
    - For easy publishing without worrying about name collisions
- The folder's name becomes the URL "slug"
- Slugs don't _have_ to be called `2014-10-11-whatever`
- Articles don't _have_ to be called `index.mdwn`

## Amitai's questions

- Are your URLs structured like `/kate/foo`? (working offline right now)
