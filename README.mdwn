# Contents

This is an attempt to meet the desiderata described by Ron Jeffries
at [xprogramming.com](http://xprogramming.com/articles/xprognew-pivot/),
using [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/). It contains:

- A `src` directory for articles, images, metadata, and other input
- An `html` directory for statically generated content (do not edit directly)
- A `conf` directory for the config file governing ikiwiki's behavior
- Git history to illustrate the steps by which I grew the site

# Discontents

- To browse the generated site, point a webserver at the `html` directory
- To repeat my results, you need ikiwiki on your system. To get it,
  I suggest using a package manager that keeps a reasonably up-to-date
  ikiwiki. I can vouch for [pkgsrc](http://www.pkgsrc.org/) doing
  so, because I'm the one who does the maintenance work. :-)
- To use ikiwiki normally, you wouldn't mimic this filesystem structure.

# This is a demo

To show my changes along with their effects, I checked just about
everything imaginable into Git. This is not how you'd use ikiwiki
for a real site.

# For a real site...

- You wouldn't check `html` into Git
- You'd create a central repository based on what's in `src` right now
- You'd clone the central repo onto your laptop
- You'd work locally, commit when you want, and push to publish
